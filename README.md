# MNIST Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
ðŸ“– Overview

This project showcases the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model predicts the categories of various fashion items such as shirts, shoes, and bags by learning from labeled grayscale images. Advanced techniques like dropout, batch normalization, and weight initialization are incorporated to improve the model's performance and robustness.

ðŸ’¡ Motivation

The primary goal of this project was to:

Explore the implementation of a neural network for image classification tasks.
Learn and apply regularization techniques like dropout to mitigate overfitting.
Utilize batch normalization to stabilize and accelerate training.
Experiment with hyperparameters and training techniques to achieve optimal performance
